# Remote IDE base container

## General information
This is my personal remote IDE base container. It spins up basic Debian container with some additional packages installed. Most importantly it works as base image for more specific IDE images.

Basic features include an SSH server for connecting (you need to figure out connectivity depending on deployment strategy)

## How to use?

### Basics
You can use this container either locally as you please or remotely through SSH. The login password is either provided by you or set randomly at container startup. If you don't provide a password, it is randomly set *each time you start the container*. The random password is printed by the container.
`.ssh/authorized_keys` is rebuilt on every container start. See below for persisting keys.

### Helm chart?!
Not yet.

### Environment variables
- `$PASSWORD` sets the login password for the `vscode`user (this cannot be changed).
- You can provide a single ssh key through the environment variable `SSH-KEY`, if it happens to contain no illegal characters.

### Special mount locations
- `/home/vscode/.ssh/authorized_keys.d` Every file under this directory ending in .key will be included in .ssh/authorized_keys.
- `/home/vscode` The home directory is persisted.

### Custom scripting
You can add scripts to be run at container startup. `/home/vscode/setup.sh` is executed in the beginning of entrypoint, right after runlevel 1. `/home/vscode/start.sh` is executed at the end, right before final entrypoint scripting and the command passed to the container. You can use sudo to run commands with higher privileges.

### Extending container
Easiest way is to build an image using this as the source image. I recommend against changing the docker-entrypoint.sh; instead, use provided runlevels 1â€“9 scripting directories under `/usr/local/bin/`. All files ending with .sh under these directories (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.d.1`) runlevels are executed at different points of docker-entrypoint, giving you a lot of control. See `/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh` for details. Note that entrypoint is run as the user, so use sudo where necessary.
